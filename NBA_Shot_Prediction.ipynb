        "Predicting the outcome of a shot attempt based on contextual factors such as location and player attributes could provide valuable insights for coaches, analysts, and players themselves.\n",
        "With advances in data collection and machine learning, it is now possible to model and predict shot outcomes more accurately than ever before."
